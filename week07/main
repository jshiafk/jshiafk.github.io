			<h4> Inspiration</h4>
			<p>I would like to make a pop out book. It will mainly focus on its sculpture feelings, and also story telling abilities.
				 <strong>I am going to use traditional paper media, since I won't have access to digital prints. I’m thinking of working with ink; and all the small paper samples I brought for digital printing tests. Perhaps there won’t be many digital parts for it, as I’m still thinking of how that would fit in.
</strong>  Here are some samples I've been looking into:
